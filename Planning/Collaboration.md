####Collaborative Style:  

* Each members individually come up with their own idea. We present the ideas during the meetings. As a group, we vote on which idea we wish to pursue. 
* After we narrow down the topics, we try to develop the idea more and send it to TA for feedbacks.
* After we get the reponse from TA, we make modifications and vote on just one idea that we want to use for this phase of the project.


In the case of any conflicts, we discuss any potential concerns as a group and see how we can minimize or resolve the conflict. We do not proceed until all group members come to a consensus. This worked well for our group meetings as members were satisfied with the final decisions. However, an area in which we can improve is coordinating the logistics of when/where/what topics the meetings will be on. Our method of using Skype does not sit well with one of our members who refuses to use Skype. We can improve this by texting that member.

####First Meeting:
Feb 1 2016, 8:00-9:00PM | BA2195 | Attendance: Everyone

1. Theme of the software to be developed:   
   Game (Entertainment) v.s. Practical  
   Leaning towards practical which addresses real life problem for a certain group of people, e.g. students or Canadian.
  
2. Specific initial ideas:  
   2.1 Transportation for GTA  
   2.2 Text-to-speech mobile app  
   2.3 Bar code scanning app for allergen alerts and dietary restrictions   
   2.4 Prioritized Scheduling   
   2.5 Hospital Database  


--------------------
####Second Meeting:
Feb 3 2016, 4:00-5:30PM | BA3200 | Attendance: Everyone  
  
Discussing each idea in detail:  

1. Transportation for GTA  
   -> Many other apps do the same;  
2. Text-to-speech for speech-disabled group   
   -> Existed;  
3. Bar code scanning app for allergen alerts and dietary restrictions  
   -> Existed;   
4. Interval Scheduling  
   -> Engaging with students--assignments (scheduling);  
   -> Phone App vs Web App;  
      Web App experience: Allen has done 309; the rest of the team are not experienced with web app.  
5. Mini games that learning alphabet for language   
   -> Duolingo served the same purpose;  
6. UofT Campus Map   
   -> Route for students to walk on campus from class to class;  
   -> Construct and return best route out of personal schedule;  
  
To-do: send a small writeup to TA about this idea and questions: 1) How to retrieve course and session with location data; 2) route optimization  

--------------------
####Third Meeting:
Feb 8 2016, 8:00-9:00PM | BA2159 | Attendance: Everyone  

TA response:   

1. not that different from Google Map
2. student will stop using it once they get familiar with the campus (one/two week(s))

New Ideas: 

1. Penpal Matching App
2. Academic Resource Trading Web
3. Events Posting Boards

To do: Each team members come up with a new idea and one will be chosen to be the final idea.

--------------------
####Fourth Meeting:
Feb 9 2016, 10:30-11:40PM | Online | Attendance: Everyone  

Ideas:   

**Math Teaching Web**
* This idea revolves around having “mathematical trees” which will be used to incrementally teach students different disciplines of math.
* Create a website that uses a hierarchical method of organization for math principles to facilitate learning/teaching of various subjects in math.  
* Due to time restraints, we may have to restrict this to just teaching one specific area of math such as quadratics.   

**Event Food Recommender**  
* A recommendations app to users to best places or events in Toronto by the category user is interested in, based on latest trends.  

**Academic Resource Market**   
* Students can buy and sell textbooks, lecture notes, recordings etc.  

**E-bulletin Board App**  
* Students can search for and register for events on campus.  
* Clubs can promote their events. There will be special categories- like free food/drinks.

**Job/Task Posting App**
* Users can either post tasks that they need help with ( homework , note taking , buying food , delivery stuff , looking for teammates, text book selling .....etc ), whatever the demand is; or they are the ones accepting the tasks. 

All ideas sent to TA.

--------------------
####Fifth Meeting:
Feb 10 2016, 1:00-3:00PM | BA3200 | Attendance: Flora and Danniel--1 to 3; Wenfeng and Allen--1 to 2; Shamama and Justin--2 to 3.

Based on the responce from TA on every ideas: 
* Flora, Wenfeng, Allen and Danniel agrees on further developing the Teaching idea more.   
* Instead of teaching Math, teaching a programming language is more needed by CS students.
* Choosing form Python, C or Java.  
  --> From past experience, C is the language that most of us (and probably other students too) aren't familiar with. Concepts like memory models can be abstract for those new to C. It will be a nice supplumentery method to learn certain concept.   

Justin and Shamama raised the question why we chose to do C/programming. How would tree learning model benifits students more than classroom learning model. 
* The value of this app is that it provides an alternative to those who aren't doing that well with classroom learning model. We are not trying to teach everybody but it expands the flexibility and possibility of teaching.
