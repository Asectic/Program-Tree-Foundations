SCRUM UPDATE FILE: WENFENG JIANG	

February 28:
=============
- talked to Allen on Skype on compiling C code
- discussed which to use : exec or spawn
- decide on exec for now:
	problem: saves to buffer so if exceeds buffer(code too long) process will fail. 
- more work split:
	- Allen : get user input from client side to server
	- me : write the input to a file so we can compile 
- got writing code to file woring 
	- merged with Allen's get user input
- working on error handling for code compiling & show code result to client-side
	- added spawn version of compiler for testing
	- added compiler inside index.js
