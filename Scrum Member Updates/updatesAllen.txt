SCRUM UPDATE FILE: Allen
[Will add onto this file periodically]

February 28:
=============
-created the express website body(the hierarchy of the website) which organizes all the files that will be used
-did research with Wenfeng on how to compile c code with the nodejs framework
-created an html page to let the user enter code and send it to the server
-in the server, written up 2 routes: 1) GET route to direct the client to the html page to enter the code
                                     2) POST route to take in the submitted code request to be compiled from the client
-plan to connect the webpages developed by teammates and try to make working prototype website
-moved solution for compiler to work from index(compiler) to main file index: compiler is now within index routes and not in seperate files
