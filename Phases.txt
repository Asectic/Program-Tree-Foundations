
Implementations of the Programming Tree Webpage

======
NOTES:
======

:: A rough draft of the phases for our purposes of keeping track - edit for any changes and indicating who will implement which part of the phases
:: Challenge: Connecting the pages together in the main interface
:: Challenge: Deciding how much content we're going to cover and in what order we're presenting them
:: Assume that "Contents" and "Exercises & tests" will have to be implemented at separate phases due to complexity and time consumption of both

==========
Phase Two:
==========

- Decide on the name of the webpage
- User account system (Database)
- Main interface system setup, with a few nodes and its subtrees completed
	-> Content & "Behind the scenes"
- Implement the "main tree" of the Programming Tree (And only the subtrees for the covered content nodes)


=============
Phase Three:
=============

- Exercise & testing systems (And tests for the answers)
- Implementing the rest of the programming tree & its subtrees

============
Last Phase
===========

- Homepage
