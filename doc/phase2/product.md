Main Idea
===============================================================================================================================================
This is an website platform to teach C language in a interactive enviroment. 

At the start of this phase, the group meeted and deliberated on the features we would include in this build. It was decided that we valued the back end functionality over front end content. With this mind set, the implemented features in this phase included a compliler for c code, a login system, node repsentation for the lessons, and the functional code for a memory allocation game. With these features, it will be much easier to build the lessons for the next phases as the functional requirements to build our MVP are already met.
