
project-team8 Process Report:
=============================

Process Overview:
------------------

1. Decided goals needed in order to produce MVP by the end of this phase. 
   a. Each goal/task was segmented into individual components and assigned to individual members. 
2. Intermediate deadlines were set for each the group member. 
3. Scrum meeting were held every 3—5 days to evaluate progress and determine next steps as well as adjust the schedule in case of any delays. 

Initial Planning and Beginning of Process: 
-------------------------------------------

The previous phase provided an excellent backbone structure to build off of for the second phase of the project. Main functionalities had already been implemented and incorporated into the website, such as: 

- Visual Tree Diagram
- Compiler
- Basic Structure of Game
- Basic Layout of Website

As such, for this phase, the group decided to focus on the following goals as they were most detrimental towards developing a polished and complete MVP: 

1. Developing a fluid user experience
2. Creating content nodes to be added to the learning trees 
3. Adjusting any bare bone implementations to something more specific (e.g., the compiler exercises, games, etc.)

Organizational Strategy:
-------------------------

Based off of successes from the previous phase, the group chose to use the Scrum method of meeting and planning in order to efficiently complete the process. The Scrum method of meeting works well for the development of the product because it allows for the creation of well-defined intermediate tasks and is flexible enough to accommodate for any delays/changes that must occur during the development process.  

<b>Definition of Scrum Master: </b> The scrum master is responsible for taking notes at each of the meetings and recording the progress of the group. The scrum master should also analyze the team meetings to synchronize and adjust plans as necessary.

<b>Adjustments to Scrum Process:</b>

- (Kept from previous phase) No product owner, entire team takes responsibility of product owner position
- (Kept from previous phase) Periodic update meetings every 3-5 days run by scrum master
- (Not kept from previous phase) Members no longer have to keep an individual update file
   -  It is redundant considering that the commit feature on github. Additionally, these weren’t referenced often and provided little advantage to the product development. 
  
Additional tools the group used to facilitate the organization of the project: 

- <b>Skype: </b>provided efficient means of communicating with multiple people at once, organizing meetings, and leaving messages for other team members to be read at a later time. 
- <b>In-person meetings:</b> Beneficial for demonstrating individual progress, explaining concepts to struggling members, deciding next steps and adjustments 
- <b>GitHub</b>: Workflow included solely committing to master (major flaw – more info in review and retrospective) 
   - Issues were used towards the end of the phase (major flaw – more info in review and retrospective)
