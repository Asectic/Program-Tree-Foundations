
project-team8 Planning Report: Phase 3
=======================================

The team's goals for this phase:
---------------------------------

For phase 3, the main goals of the "Programming Tree" webpage implementations were the following:

1. Fully implement the tree in Javascript as the following:

	- There is a set of main tree nodes, each on a different "div" element level encompassing each set of content topics
	- EX: "Chapter 1 Basic C Syntax", "Chapter 2: Memory Allocation and Pointers", etc
	- For each main tree node clicked, implement a set of sub tree nodes <b>on a separate page</b> from the main tree nodes
	- EX: In chapter 2 "Pointers", "Memory Model", "Pointers and Arrays", etc
	
2. To implement the content of the webpage in two page formats

	- For content pages that have a corresponding game, split the page below the navigation bar into two parts
	- For content pages with no game, just leave it all under one "main" div element

	<b>Content Pages Implemented:</b>
	- Pointers
	- Memory Model
	- Basic Syntax
	- Variables

3. Finising the games for the content pages: memory model allocation
4. Complete the login and register forms, enabling the page to redirect upon login or register user success
