Like with another work I couldn't get off my mind for specific reasons, for this post I will be discussing &amp; reviewing another work. (After writing for a while feels like an another introduction *-*). This time a webtoon that is called Black Haze.<br>
    
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Contents:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Synopsis and Publishing</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Thoughts and Discussions</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Conclusions and Reasonings</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">References and Sites</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Again with me being me, I may lay some spoilers about the series here and there. So if you're the type that absolutely doesn't want to be told, like say how the ending of a movie, then read at your own risk!</p>
    
<p style="text-align: center;">|| SYNOPSIS &amp; PUBLISHING ||</p>
    
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://asectic.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/black-haze-cover_200x0.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-56" src="https://asectic.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/black-haze-cover_200x0.jpg" alt="black-haze-cover_200x0" width="200" height="278" /></a></p>
    
<p style="text-align: center;">(Image courtesy of the mangacow website. There are better covers for this but I'm just lazy at this point)</p>
    
<p style="text-align: left;">Since there are bound to be people who don't know what this series is, I will breifly exaplain it. Black Haze is a Korean webtoon series written and drawn by Yong Yong, where it is currently being serialized and updated in Foxtoons. I have tried finding at what month and year this work was published but I could not, but all I can say that it originally debuted in Naver in 2012 where then the releases were on biweekly (2 weeks). Since Naver is the most famous place for popular webtoons, they did not have enough space and so this work eventually moved to TTale publishing only to find out couple of years later the contract was bad. And so during early spring of 2015 the work went on hiatus for a couple of long weeks, but soon came back up running again in Foxtoons publishing.</p>
    
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Genres</strong>: School life, shounen, comedy, action, supernatural, fantasy</p>
    
<p style="text-align: left;">This work "<em>follows the story of Rood Chrishi, a boy who carries a secret -- he is actually the famous Black Magician, [Blow], one of the youngest but strongest magicians in the world. In spite of this, lately, his organization's master has only been sending him out on trivial missions, like running errands and orchestrating petty revenge schemes for clients.</em>" (Credit to link #1). After a mission that has gone terribly wrong, Rood's is then sent to the famous magic school Helios - where due to reasons that are explained &amp; told in the webtoon he is to look after a noblewomen's second son who is currently being bullied at school.</p>
    
<p style="text-align: left;">This webtoon, like any other rather overhyped manga features a rather overpowered character as the story's main character. But let's not stop just there, for those who tend to hate such settings. In the next few sections I will more expand more on this topic, and as well as others to this webtoon.</p>
    
<p style="text-align: center;">|| THOUGHTS &amp; DISCUSSIONS ||</p>
    
<p style="text-align: left;">While I know that webtoons on general are well less under-appreciated in comparison to other genres such as manga, I feel that in comparisons to the more popular works such as Noblesse, Tower of God, and God of High School this work is less on the scale in terms of popularity. (Well at least that's how I view it anyways based on MF and the anime amino app).</p>
    
<p style="text-align: left;">So how should I really start describing Black Haze? I suppose I will start with the prologue, where in it they describe the basic premise of the world of this story in the premise of a "once upon a time" sort of thing. But since this IS Black Haze after all, the prologue adds a twist - the magic that is used by the magicians is supposedly have been originated or given from the Demon King.</p>
    
<p style="text-align: left;">From there, the first few chapters start off with introducing the main character in his magician form - where on top of the serious moments &amp; magic-fight action that occurs, the comedy moments are dropped right from the get-go. I admit, the first time I read this series I dropped it right after the first chapter - since during the beginning chapters I found the art to be very shabby to the point where some of the character's proportions were a bit off. But after giving it another go, I gradually found this webtoon to be hilarious - and yet it has a very suspenseful and good plot which makes readers always questioning "what will happen next", and "what happened in this moment of the story in the past?". In short, Yong is one of those authors who at the end of each chapters leaves a cliffhanger - making me and as well as fellow fans with the reaction of "Dammit! What's going to happen next!! Another whole week of waiting....".</p>
    
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Story Aspects:</strong></p>
    
<p style="text-align: left;">The art gradually improves as the story progresses on; and with it more great story, random and hilarious moments, and magic fighting action occurs. In the previous section I have mention that Rood is one of those overpowered characters such as Kirito from SAO. But in all the number of times I have read and re-read the story, I have never seen the MC use his powers other than in times of absolute crisis. If anything, I love how conservative and secretive the MC is trying to be, where especially with the .... "weird" characters around him he is always found struggling to <em>keep his sanity during his missions</em>.</p>
    
<p style="text-align: left;">^ I am not joking with that last comment. The following (below) will explain just why the MC is undergoing all this trouble. In other words, what I want to say is that like with this webtoon as a whole, everything of what the reader initially assumes for this work will end up being completely betrayed in a random and good way.</p>
    
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Characters:</strong></p>
    
<p style="text-align: left;">I won't go too much into this, since describing may just spoil the living daylights out of future potent readers. But all I will say is that the 3 potent characters to watch out for (and some of my absolute favourites) is the Master of Opion, Shicmuon, and Tessiana. The general conclusions to them, and to my view in a story as a whole is: "concepts such as trolling and stalking people has never been made so normal before".  (This was purely my thoughts and not taken from any other site or person.) Where in other works and as society rule in general, these things are viewed as bad to the point of being charged and put to jail.</p>
    
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>The turn-offs:</strong></p>
    
<p style="text-align: left;">After reading and participating in some discussions with other fellow fans, I have come across a few reasons as to why there are those who are not in favor of this work. In short...</p>

<ul>
	<li style="text-align: left;">The first few chapters mainly involve introducing the story &amp; characters, and so with lack of serious plot yet the authors uses comedy. But some people as they started reading this did not understand the comedy or knew there even was one, so after first 3 chapters said they dropped the work.</li>
	<li style="text-align: left;">A whole majority of the time we are like the MC, as he gets more and more into his missions he only ends up questioning more &amp; more on what's going on - rather then having anything of plot explained. This continues on to be revealed only after 100 chapters later. And by that point readers may feel that enough comedy is enough and start to lose interest.</li>
	<li style="text-align: left;">Let's not forget the art in the beginning as well, which was shabby.</li>
</ul>
But other than that, overall this webtoon has an amazing story &amp; absolute hilarious scenes that is incorporated even into the fighting and action scenes. Overall I feel, that with the current chapter that was released featuring Master's past, Yong is an intelligent storyteller who even with a seeming predictable story-line so far, loves to leave surprises and random moments into the mix.
<p style="text-align: center;">|| CONCLUSIONS &amp; REASONINGS ||</p>
    
<p style="text-align: left;">I believe that the above section has mentioned the main points I wanted to say, so I will just mention the good and bad points about Black Haze. And as well as my own personal ratings for it.</p>
    
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>PROs:</strong></span></p>

<ul>
	<li style="text-align: left;">Comedy: Even though in later chapters you predict just something will happen in a funny way, the reader gets it in the most random fashion ever. This also serves as a constant mood lightener of the story.</li>
	<li style="text-align: left;">"Naruto" type storyline: Where the plot right from the prologue of the story serves as a connection and is mainly used even until the recent chapters.</li>
	<li style="text-align: left;">Unpredictable moments: not just from the comedic moments but from the story as a whole the author just throws something reader does not expect at all.</li>
	<li style="text-align: left;">Great cast of characters &amp; their development: I have asked a few people in who their favorite character was, and one have mentioned that it was too hard for them to list one since all were great.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>CONs:</strong></span></p>

<ul>
	<li style="text-align: left;">Plot-line of the story may be at a risk of being predictable at times (can be obvious to reader in other words).</li>
	<li style="text-align: left;">Shabby art in the beginning.</li>
	<li style="text-align: left;">Too much comedy between the chapters until serious plot reveal may turn-off some readers.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>My Overall Rankings:</strong></span></p>
    
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Story</strong>: 8 / 10</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Art</strong>: 7.5 / 10</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Characters</strong>: 8.5 /10</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Overall Enjoyment</strong>: 10 /10</p>
    
<p style="text-align: center;">The format is taken from the MAL website, as how other users have done in terms of manga entries. Since unfortunately this webtoon does not have an entry listed under MAL, I figured it was at last time for something to happen. The scores were scaled based on MAL's as usual; and this time each were done individually - even the "Overall Enjoyment" section.</p>
    
<p style="text-align: left;">As one can guess from the way I have described this work until now, even with its various faults, my personal opinion is that this work is a masterpiece. Currently being my first favorite within the webtoon category, in comparison to what other fans have ranked theirs at. This was a somewhat of an introduction/discussions/review ... or I guess a general blog of random thoughts and stuff on Black Haze. Asectic is out! Let me just end this by listing some of the sites and references while I'm at it!</p>
